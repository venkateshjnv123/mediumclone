React-Native MMKV is now a prominent option for data storage in React Native applications. One of the key advantages of React-Native MMKV is its performance. With everything written in C++, it is ~30x faster than AsyncStorage. Furthermore, it also provides encryption support, making it a secure storage solution for your app. The use of JSI instead of the “old” Bridge further enhances its speed and efficiency.",
